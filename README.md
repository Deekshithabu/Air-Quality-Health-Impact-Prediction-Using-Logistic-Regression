# Air-Quality-Health-Impact-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
This project uses the Kaggle “Air Quality Data in India” dataset, containing daily pollutant readings from multiple cities.
A Flask-based web app allows users to:
* Train a Logistic Regression model on pollutant data
* Input pollutant levels and instantly predict health risk
* View the probability of unhealthy air quality
The model helps visualize how pollution levels translate into potential health risks.
